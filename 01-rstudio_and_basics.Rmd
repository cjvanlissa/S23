# Preparing for the course

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
```
This Chapter helps you prepare for the course. It shows how to install R and RStudio on your computer. We'll also provide some general information on R, and how you can get help if you get error messages. 

If you're already using R, all of this might be nothing new for you. You may **skip** this chapter then.

If you have **never used R before, this Chapter is essential**, as it gives you some input on how R works, and how we can use it for our data analyses.


## Installing software 

If you use R on your own computer, you will need to install it yourself. You should first:

1. Install R from https://CRAN.R-project.org
2. Install ‘RStudio’ Desktop (Free) from https://rstudio.com

<br><br>

### Installing packages {#installpackages}

As a prerequisite for this guide, you need to have a few essential **R packages** installed.

1. Open RStudio
2. Inside RStudio, find the window named **Console** on the bottom left corner of your screen (it might fill the entire left side of the screen).
3. We will now install a few packages using R Code. Here's an overview of the packages, and why we need them:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
Package<-c("MplusAutomation", "ggplot2", "tidySEM", "semTools")
Description<-c("Control Mplus from R and parse model output", "A flexible and user-friendly plotting package", "Plotting and tabulating the output of SEM-models", "Comparing models, establishing measurement invariance across groups")
m<-data.frame(Package,Description)
names<-c("Package", "Description")
colnames(m)<-names
kable(m)
```
  
<br><br>

To install these packages, we use the `install.packages()` function in R. One package after another, our code should look like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("MplusAutomation")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("tidySEM")
install.packages("semTools")
```

<br><br>

### Get started

### Starting a new project in Rstudio
 
To keep all your work organized, you should use a **project**. In Rstudio, click on the *New project* button:

![](tut_new_proj.png)

In the pop-up dialog, click *New directory*, and again *New project*.

type the desired directory name in the dialog (give it a meaningful name, e.g. "TCSM_course"), and use 'Browse' if you need to change the directory where you store your projects. Now, in your project, click *File > New file > R script*. This script file works just like notepad, or the syntax editor in SPSS: You type plain text, but you can run it any time you want. Conduct all of the exercises in this script file.

### Code conventions

Throughout the guide, a consistent set of conventions is used to refer to code:

* Functions are in a code font and followed by parentheses, like
`sum()` or `mean()`.
* Other R objects (like data or function arguments) are in a code
font, without parentheses, like `seTE` or `method.tau`. 
* Sometimes, we’ll use the package name followed by two colons, like
`lavaan::sem()`. This is valid R code and will run. The `lavaan::` part indicates that the function `sem()` comes from the package `lavaan`.

### Getting Help

As you start to apply the techniques described in this guide to your data you will soon find questions that the guide does not answer. This section describes a few tips on how to get help.

1. Every function in R has documentation (a help file). To see it, select the name of the function and press F1, or run the command `?` followed by the name of the function, e.g.: `?aov`. I have been using R for 10 years, and I still press F1 all the time to see how a function works.
2. If you get stuck, start with **Google**. Typically, adding “R” to a search is enough to restrict it to relevant results, e.g.: "exploratory factor analysis R". Google is particularly useful for error messages. If you get an error message and you have no idea what it means, try googling it. Chances are that someone else has been confused by it in the past, and there will be help somewhere on the web. (If the error message isn’t in English,
run `Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "en")` and re-run the code; you’re
more likely to find help for English error messages.)
3. If Google doesn’t help, try [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). Start by spending a little time searching for an existing answer; including [R] restricts your search to questions and answers that use R.
4. Lastly, if you stumble upon an error (or typos!) in this guide's text or R syntax, feel free to contact **Caspar van Lissa** at **c.j.vanlissa@uu.nl**.

## Getting the course data

All of the course data files are available on a GitHub repository. You can download them all at once by going to https://github.com/cjvanlissa/S23_student, clicking the green button labeled 'Code', and downloading a ZIP archive of the repository.

![](coursematerials.png)

After unzipping the archive, you can open the RStudio project 'S23_student.Rproj', and the script 'run_me.R'. This script contains a few lines of code to help you install the required R-packages for the course.

## R tutorial for beginners (optional)

Welcome to the world of R! This tutorial is based on the tutorial "R: How to get started" by [Ihnwhi Heo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ihnwhi-heo/), [Duco Veen](https://www.ducoveen.com/), and [Rens van de Schoot](https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/), and adapted for TCSM.

### Who R you?

R is...

-	Free programming software for statistical computation and graphics
-	Open source: everyone (even you!) can improve, develop, and contribute to R
-	The official manual by the R Core Team: [An introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf)

R itself looks a bit old-fashioned and tedious:

### RStudio

Thankfully, we have a great user interface for R, called RStudio!

-	RStudio helps users to use and learn R easier
-	If you are using RStudio, this means you are using R.
-	From now on, all tutorials will go with RStudio.

#### No ‘pane’, no gain!

When you open RStudio, the screen may look like this. You may notice that the screen is divided into A ‘panes’ (a pane is a division of a window): 

![](tut_panes.jpg)

Before we explain these three panes - I want you to add the fourth one, which you will see if you open an R script. An R script is like a "new document" in Microsoft Word. When you open an R script, the fourth pane appears.

#### Create a new R script

Click the icon with a plus sign on the paper. Click the icon highlighted by the red square: 

![](tut_new_file.png)


When you click the icon, a new script appears in a fourth pane on the upper left side of the screen

![](tut_panes2.jpg)

The four panes really help become organized. In RStudio, you can do everything all together on one screen. Thus, four panes make the work efficient (indeed, no ‘pain’!).

#### What do the four panes do?

-	Out of four panes, the two on the left side are the panes you will use a lot.
    -	Source pane: located at the top left side of the screen. It is also called the "editor", because this is where we edit scripts. We will usually type our code in the source pane.
    -	Console pane: located at the bottom left side of the screen. This panel is for direct communication with R. We can type commands here that are *immediately* evaluated (whereas a script is only evaluated when we run it). Furthermore, all output of our commands is printed in this console pane.
-	The panels on the right side of the screen contain various tabs. Among those tabs, it is worth looking at the Environment tab at the upper pane and the Plots tab at the lower pane.
    -	The Environment tab contains all the ‘objects’ currently loaded in your R session. In SPSS, you can have only one data file open. In R, you can have as many data 'objects' as you like. They will be listed here. You can always check what objects are loaded under the environment tab. The environment is also called the 'workspace'.
    -	The Plots tab shows various graphs and figures we draw. If you click Zoom with the magnifying glass, you can see plots in a bigger size.
